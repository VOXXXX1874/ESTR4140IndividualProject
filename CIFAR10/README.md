Because there too many experiments I have performed before. I only attach the code that related to experiments that presented in my report.

The "resnet.ipynb" is to perform training in step 1 of IBDAM in the section of "experiment on the unbiased dataset".

The "history" folder stores the results of performing training in step 2,3 of IBDAM in the section of "experiment on the unbiased dataset".

The "interprete.ipynb" is to give the interpretation about model prediction

The "resnet18_label.ipynb" is to perform training in step 1 of IBDAM in the section of "experiment on Ideal ShortCut Dataset".

The "generateIdealHeatmap.ipynb" is to generate the interpretation heatmap in step 1 of IBDAM in the section of "experiment on Ideal ShortCut Dataset"

The "ideal_cutout.ipynb" is to perform training in step 2,3 of IBDAM in the section of "experiment on Ideal ShortCut Dataset" with cutout data augmentation.

The "ideal_cutout _compare.ipynb" is to perform comparison between IBDAM and other data augmentation method.
