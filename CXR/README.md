Because there too many experiments I have performed before. I only attach the code that related to experiments that presented in my report.

The "data_processing.ipynb", "divideDataset.ipynb", and "downsample.ipynb" is to preprocess the X-Ray image and build the dataset.

The "interprete.ipynb" is to generate the interpretation.

The "resnet.ipynb" is to perform the training in step 1 of IBDAM method in the section 5.4 of the report.

The "age_transfer.ipynb" is to perform transfer learning of age on the origin model in step 1 of IBDAM in the section 5.4 of the report.

The "resnet_heapmap_generation.ipynb" is to generate the interpretation heatmpa in step2 of IBDAM.

The "history/ibdam" contains codes for the step 2, 3 of IBDAM method and the final age transfer learning result

The "hisotry/shorT" contains the implementation of shorT method with -0.001 age learning scale.

The "hisotry/dropout" constains the some implementation and result of the activation and gradient based dropout method mentioned in the last part of report.
