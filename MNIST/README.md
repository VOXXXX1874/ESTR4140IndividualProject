Because there too many experiments I have performed before. I only attach the code that related to experiments that presented in my report.

The "interpret.ipynb" is to generate the interpretation result. Given a model and a file, it will generate the interpretation and store in a certain folder.

The "shifted_MNIST.ipynb" is to generate the biased train dataset in my report.

The "resnet18_unbiased.ipynb" is to train the model on the unbiased dataset in my report.

The "resnet18.ipynb" is to train the model on the biased dataset in my report.
